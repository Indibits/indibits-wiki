this file is abut the functionality
>>during installation we ask the user for a username and a pass
>>that ll be the owner_super username and pass
>>see we need an acccount facility so here the accounts can be created only by the admin_super;;
>>and each time he creates an account he sets one username and pass
>>and so account can be created only by the owner_super 
>>each time he creates an account he has to assign 3 roles
owner
editor 
trivial account
>>why we need trivial account is that once the owner_super creates an account for XYZ  makes him an owner or an editor 
>>and later some time he might want to remove editor or owner privilleges of XYZ 
>>now the the owner_super may not want to remove the account;ie he may not want to delete the account;
>>so there has to be an account which is neither an owner nor editor
